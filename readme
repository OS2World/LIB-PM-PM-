	This is freeware. You can modify or use this code as you wish,
provided that my portion of the code reamins freeware (ie available 
to anyone, in listing form) and that you keep my notice at the beginning 
of each file.

    This archive contains the PM++ class library by G.Iachello version 0.15
    There is a makefile for building the whole thing.
    
    You'll need: 
        emx 0.9a rev. 3 
        dmake
        
    To install this package, edit the beginning of the makefile and set
the directory definitions to point to your directories. (This is not 
necessary if the emx dir is in the root of the default drive). Then type:

    dmake all
    
	to build the library, dll and example program.


	Note: To build the help file for the example program, you'll need 
the IPF compiler, and the IPF preprocessor by Larry Salomon (a public domain
program found on the hobbes archive).
